# Penguin Species Data Analysis
This repository contains the Python project for analyzing cytochrome-b sequences of various penguin species. The analysis includes translating DNA sequences into amino acids, calculating molecular weights and GC content, and exploring the data through visualizations.

## Project Overview

This project aims to provide insights into 12 different species of penguins by analyzing their genetic information and physical data. I translated the cytochrome-b sequences to amino acids, calculate the molecular weight of these sequences, determine their GC content, and visualize the data alongside the average adult mass of each species.

## Repository Structure

- `sequence_translate.py`: Python script of Dr.X containing functions for DNA translation and insturctions for further data analysis.
- `penguins_mass.csv`: Dataset including the average adult mass of each penguin species.
- `penguins_cytb.fasta`: FASTA file containing cytochrome-b sequences of the penguin species.
- `penguins_mass_cytb.csv`:New DataFrame including mass, molecular weight and GC-content.
- `Python_Assignment_Goswami.ipynb`: Jupyter notebook that documents the workflow and analysis.

## Installation

To set up my environment to run these notebooks, I needed Python 3 and the following packages:
- BioPython
- Pandas
- Matplotlib
- Seaborn
Installed the required packages using pip.
